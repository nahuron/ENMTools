\title{Takes an emtools.species object with presence and background points, and builds a random forest model}
\usage{
enmtools.rf(
  species,
  env,
  f = NULL,
  test.prop = 0,
  eval = TRUE,
  nback = 1000,
  env.nback = 10000,
  report = NULL,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  rts.reps = 0,
  bg.source = "default",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{An enmtools.species object}

\item{env}{A raster or raster stack of environmental data.}

\item{f}{A formula for fitting the model}

\item{test.prop}{Proportion of data to withhold randomly for model evaluation, or "block" for spatially structured evaluation.}

\item{eval}{Determines whether model evaluation should be done.  Turned on by default, but moses turns it off to speed things up.}

\item{nback}{Number of background points to draw from range or env, if background points aren't provided}

\item{env.nback}{Number of points to draw from environment space for environment space discrimination metrics.}

\item{report}{Optional name of an html file for generating reports}

\item{overwrite}{TRUE/FALSE whether to overwrite a report file if it already exists}

\item{rts.reps}{The number of replicates to do for a Raes and ter Steege-style test of significance}

\item{bg.source}{Source for drawing background points.  If "points", it just uses the background points that are already in the species object.  If "range", it uses the range raster.  If "env", it draws points at randome from the entire study area outlined by the first environmental layer.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to rf()}

\value{
